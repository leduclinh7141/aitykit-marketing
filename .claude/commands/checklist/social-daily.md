## Language & Quality Standards

**CRITICAL**: Respond in the same language the user is using. If Vietnamese, respond in Vietnamese. If Spanish, respond in Spanish.

**Standards**: Token efficiency, sacrifice grammar for concision, list unresolved questions at end.

**Skills**: Activate `social-media`, `marketing-fundamentals`, `crm-workflow.md`, `sales-workflow.md` skills.

**Module 1.2: Working with Marketing Files**

As a marketer, you work with many file types: campaign briefs, content drafts, research docs, analytics reports. Let's master organizing and managing them efficiently.

**Duration:** ~25 minutes

---

### Step 1: Review Current Structure

```
Show me everything in exercises/markit/ with full structure
```

Explain the organizational logic:
- Group by function (campaigns, content, brand, research)
- Subfolders for content types (blog, email, social)
- Clear naming conventions

### Step 2: Create Content Templates

Guide them to create reusable templates:

```
Create these templates in exercises/markit/templates/:

1. blog-post-template.md - Structure for blog posts with SEO checklist
2. email-template.md - Framework for marketing emails
3. social-post-template.md - Format for social media posts
4. campaign-brief-template.md - Complete campaign brief structure

Include placeholder text and instructions in each.
```

### Step 3: Organize a Campaign Folder

```
Create a complete folder structure for Q2 campaign in exercises/markit/campaigns/q2-growth/:

- brief.md (campaign overview)
- timeline.md (project schedule)  
- budget.md (budget breakdown)
- assets-list.md (creative requirements)
- metrics.md (KPIs and tracking)
```

### Step 4: Practice File Finding

Teach search techniques:

```
Find all files that mention "Manager Mark"
```

```
Show me all markdown files in the brand folder
```

```
Search for files containing "trial signup"
```

### Step 5: Batch Operations

Demonstrate batch updates:

```
Review all files in exercises/markit/brand/ and create a summary document listing what each file contains.
Save as exercises/markit/brand/README.md
```

### Step 6: Cross-Reference Content

Show the power of working with multiple files:

```
Read the brand voice guide and Manager Mark persona.
Then write a short LinkedIn post for Planerio that:
- Matches the brand voice
- Speaks to Mark's pain points
- Includes a clear CTA

Save to exercises/markit/content/social/linkedin-post-1.md
```

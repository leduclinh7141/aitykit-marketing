**Module 2.4: Analyze Campaign Data**

Data analysis is often time-consuming. Let's master turning data into actionable insights and compelling reports.

**Duration:** ~35 minutes

### Step 1: Create Sample Data

First, generate realistic campaign data to analyze:

```
Create a sample campaign performance dataset:

File: exercises/markit/analytics/q1-campaign-data.csv

Include 30 days of data with columns:
- Date
- Channel (LinkedIn, Google, Email, Organic)
- Campaign
- Spend
- Impressions
- Clicks
- Conversions
- Revenue

Make it realistic with:
- Different performance by channel
- Some clear winners and losers
- Weekly patterns
- Overall positive trend
```

### Step 2: Campaign Performance Analysis

```
Analyze the Q1 campaign data and create a report:

OVERALL PERFORMANCE:
- Total spend, conversions, revenue
- ROI and ROAS
- Cost per acquisition
- Conversion rate

BY CHANNEL:
- Performance breakdown
- Best and worst performers
- Efficiency metrics (CPA, ROAS)

BY CAMPAIGN:
- Top 5 performing campaigns
- Bottom 5 (candidates for optimization)

TRENDS:
- Week-over-week patterns
- Day-of-week analysis
- Performance trajectory

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Where to increase spend

### Step 3: Content Performance Analysis

```
Create sample content metrics:

File: exercises/markit/analytics/content-performance.csv

Include data for 20 blog posts:
- Title
- Publish date
- Views
- Avg time on page
- Bounce rate
- Conversions
- Traffic source

Then analyze:
- Top performers by traffic
- Top performers by conversion
- Common patterns in winners
- Underperformers to improve
- Content gaps to fill

Save as exercises/markit/analytics/content-analysis.md
```

### Step 4: Executive Summary

```
Create executive summary report:

# Q1 Marketing Performance - Executive Summary

## Headline Metrics (vs targets)
- Revenue
- New customers
- ROI
- CAC

## Key Wins (top 3 with data)

## Key Challenges (top 3 with impact)

## Channel Performance Snapshot (table)

## Key Learnings (3 insights)

## Q2 Recommendations (prioritized)

## Budget Request (with justification)

Keep it to ONE PAGE.
Save as exercises/markit/analytics/q1-executive-summary.md
```

### Step 5: Multi-Channel Attribution

```
Create attribution analysis:

Describe customer journey patterns:
- Common paths to conversion
- Which channels start journeys (awareness)
- Which channels close deals (conversion)
- Average touchpoints to conversion
- Undervalued channels

Include recommendations for budget reallocation.

Save as exercises/markit/analytics/attribution-analysis.md
```

### Step 6: Data-to-Action Framework

Teach the framework:

```
For each insight, document:

1. OBSERVATION: What does the data show?
2. INSIGHT: Why is this happening?
3. IMPLICATION: What does it mean for us?
4. RECOMMENDATION: What should we do?
5. EXPECTED IMPACT: What will change?
6. RESOURCES NEEDED: What's required?

Apply this to the top 3 findings from our analysis.

```

### Step 7: Reporting Template

```
Create a reusable monthly reporting template:

## Monthly Marketing Report Template

### Section 1: Executive Summary (1 page)
### Section 2: Channel Performance (2 pages)
### Section 3: Campaign Deep Dives (3 pages)
### Section 4: Content Performance (2 pages)
### Section 5: Conversion Funnel (1 page)
### Section 6: Recommendations (1 page)

Include data requirements for each section.

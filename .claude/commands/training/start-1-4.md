### Lesson Overview

---

**Module 1.4: Using Agents for Marketing**

Agents are one of Claude Code's most powerful features. Think of them as AI team members who can work on tasks independently while you focus on other things.

**Duration:** ~35 minutes

---

### Step 1: Explain Why Agents Matter

Traditional marketing workflows require:
- Multiple team members with different expertise
- Back-and-forth reviews and revisions
- Coordinating schedules for meetings
- Waiting for feedback from stakeholders

With agents, you can:
- Get multiple perspectives instantly
- Run parallel workflows simultaneously
- Complete complex projects in minutes, not days

### Step 2: First Agent Exercise - Campaign Review

```
Review the campaign brief at exercises/markit/campaigns/q1-launch/brief.md from three perspectives:

1. As a Creative Director - evaluate creative strategy and messaging
2. As a Data Analyst - assess measurement plan and KPIs  
3. As a Budget Manager - review budget allocation and ROI projections

For each perspective, provide:
- What's working well
- Areas for improvement
- Specific recommendations

Save as exercises/markit/campaigns/q1-launch/brief-review.md
```

Explain what just happened - three specialized reviews in one command.

### Step 3: Parallel Content Creation

```
Create content for the Q1 launch in parallel:

Agent 1: Write 3 blog post outlines targeting our SEO keywords
Agent 2: Create 10 LinkedIn posts (mix of formats)
Agent 3: Write 5-email welcome sequence for trial signups
Agent 4: Create Google Ads copy (10 headline + description combos)

All content should follow our brand voice and target Manager Mark persona.
Save each in appropriate folders under exercises/markit/content/
```

### Step 4: Multi-Perspective Feedback

```
Review all content we just created from these perspectives:

1. Brand Guardian: Does it match our brand voice?
2. SEO Specialist: Is it optimized for search?
3. Conversion Expert: Will it drive action?

Each reviewer should:
- Score the content (1-10)
- List 3 strengths
- List 3 improvements needed

Save combined feedback as exercises/markit/analytics/content-review.md
```

### Step 5: Real-World Scenario - Competitive Response

```
SCENARIO: A competitor just announced a "team focus" feature.

Create a response campaign using parallel agents:

Agent 1: Analyze their announcement and positioning
Agent 2: Draft our counter-positioning and key messages
Agent 3: Create comparison content (us vs them)
Agent 4: Write social media response posts (5 posts)
Agent 5: Draft email to existing customers highlighting our advantages

Save everything in exercises/markit/campaigns/competitive-response/
```

### Step 6: Discuss Agent Best Practices

Share these tips:
- Be specific with agent objectives
- Provide reference materials (brand guides, personas)
- Define outputs clearly (format, length, location)
- Use parallel for independent tasks
- Use sequential when context builds

### What's Next

Tell them:
- They just did work that would take a team days
- **Next:** `/start-1-5` - Custom Marketing Sub-Agents
- They'll create specialized AI reviewers they can reuse

## Key Teaching Points
- Agents enable parallel workflows
- Multiple perspectives catch more issues
- Combine parallel + sequential for complex projects
- Agent output is high-quality draft work to refine
- Agents compress weeks into hours

### Welcome the Student

Say something like:

---

**Welcome to AityKit Marketing Mastery!**

I'm excited to guide you through this course. Unlike traditional courses, you'll learn by actually doing marketing work - right here in Claude Code.

**What we'll cover:**
- Module 0: Getting Started (you're here!)
- Module 1: Core Concepts - Agents, workflows, commands, project memory
- Module 2: Advanced Applications - Campaigns, content, analytics, SEO

**The practice project:**
Throughout this course, you'll work on **Markit** - a realistic marketing agency project. Your client is **Planerio**, a B2B SaaS product (team productivity coordination tool).

**How this works:**
1. I guide you through each lesson interactively
2. You'll use real commands like `/campaign:plan`, `/content:blog`, `/seo:keywords`
3. Each lesson builds on the previous one
4. Type the next slash command when you're ready to continue

### Check Their Setup

Ask them:

### End with Encouragement

Remind them that no coding experience is needed - if they can describe what they want, they can use Claude Code for marketing.

## Key Teaching Points
- This is learn-by-doing, not passive reading
- Markit agency / Planerio client is the practice project
- Each `/training:start-X-X` command begins a lesson
- The real marketing commands (`/campaign:*`, `/content:*`, `/seo:*`) are what they'll master

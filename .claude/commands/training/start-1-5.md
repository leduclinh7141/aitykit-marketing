Reviewer agents give you on-demand experts for each area.

- Validates against brand guidelines
- Flags off-brand content

**`seo-specialist`:**

**`conversion-optimizer`:**

### Step 3: The Persona Reviewers

Explain the three persona reviewers:

**`manager-maria` (Marketing Manager, 38yo):**
- B2B mid-size company perspective
- Evaluates team implementation fit
- Considers resource constraints

### Step 4: Use Expert Reviewers

Practice with expert reviewers:

```
Review our Planerio blog post with expert reviewers:

1. `brand-voice-guardian`: Evaluate brand consistency
2. `seo-specialist`: Evaluate SEO optimization
3. `conversion-optimizer`: Evaluate conversion potential

Each should score (1-10) and provide:
- Top 3 strengths
- Top 3 improvements needed
- Specific recommended edits
```

### Step 5: Use Persona Reviewers

Practice with persona reviewers:

```
Review our Planerio email sequence from persona perspectives:

1. `manager-maria`: Would a B2B marketing manager find this valuable?
2. `solo-steve`: Would a solopreneur implement this?
3. `startup-sam`: Would this drive growth for a startup?

Each should evaluate:
- Resonance with their needs
- Implementation feasibility
- Value perception
```

### Step 6: Combined Review Board

Use all reviewers together for comprehensive feedback:

```
Run a full review board on the Planerio landing page copy:

Expert Reviews:
- Brand consistency (brand-voice-guardian)
- SEO optimization (seo-specialist)
- Conversion potential (conversion-optimizer)

Persona Reviews:
- B2B fit (manager-maria)
- Self-service potential (solo-steve)
- Growth potential (startup-sam)

Synthesize: What changes would satisfy all reviewers?
```

### Step 7: Iterative Improvement

Show the review-improve cycle:

```
1. Create content
2. Get multi-reviewer feedback
3. Implement top priority changes
4. Re-review changed content
5. Repeat until all reviewers score 8+
```

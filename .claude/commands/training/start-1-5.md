## Instructions for Claude

Teach students to create reusable specialized reviewer personas.

### Lesson Overview

---

**Module 1.5: Custom Marketing Sub-Agents**

Sub-agents are specialized AI personas you create to review and improve your work. Think of them as expert consultants on-demand.

**Duration:** ~30 minutes

---

### Step 1: Why Custom Sub-Agents?

Every piece of marketing should be reviewed from multiple angles:
- Brand consistency
- SEO optimization
- Conversion potential
- Clarity and engagement
- Target persona fit

Custom sub-agents give you on-demand experts for each area.

### Step 2: Create Brand Voice Guardian

```
Create a custom reviewer persona called "Brand Voice Guardian".
Save as exercises/markit/brand/reviewers/brand-voice-guardian.md

This reviewer should:
- Know our brand voice guidelines
- Understand our target personas
- Check tone, language, and messaging consistency
- Flag off-brand phrases
- Suggest improvements to align with brand

Include:
1. Reviewer persona description
2. What they look for
3. Common issues they catch
4. How they provide feedback
5. Example review format
```

### Step 3: Create SEO Specialist

```
Create an SEO Specialist reviewer.
Save as exercises/markit/brand/reviewers/seo-specialist.md

This reviewer evaluates:
- Keyword usage and optimization
- Meta descriptions and titles
- Content structure (H1, H2, etc.)
- Internal linking opportunities
- Readability and scannability
- Search intent alignment
```

### Step 4: Create Conversion Expert

```
Create a Conversion Expert reviewer.
Save as exercises/markit/brand/reviewers/conversion-expert.md

This reviewer focuses on:
- CTA clarity and placement
- Value proposition strength
- Objection handling
- Social proof usage
- Urgency and scarcity
- Friction points in the funnel
```

### Step 5: Create Persona Reviewer

```
Create a "Manager Mark" Reviewer.
Save as exercises/markit/brand/reviewers/persona-mark-reviewer.md

This reviewer asks: "Would this resonate with Manager Mark?"
- Checks if pain points match his frustrations
- Evaluates if language suits his level
- Verifies examples are relevant to his world
- Assesses if CTA fits his decision process
```

### Step 6: Use the Review Board

Now use all reviewers together:

```
I have a blog post at exercises/markit/content/blog/post-1-draft.md

Have these reviewers evaluate it:
1. Brand Voice Guardian
2. SEO Specialist  
3. Conversion Expert
4. Manager Mark Reviewer

Each should provide:
- Score (1-10)
- Top 3 strengths
- Top 3 improvements needed
- Specific edits

Save combined review as exercises/markit/content/blog/post-1-review.md
```

### Step 7: Iterative Improvement

```
Based on the review feedback, improve the blog post.
Address the top issues from each reviewer.
Save the improved version as exercises/markit/content/blog/post-1-v2.md
```

Then have reviewers check again:

```
Have all 4 reviewers do a quick final check of the v2 post.
If all score 8+, mark as ready for publishing.
```

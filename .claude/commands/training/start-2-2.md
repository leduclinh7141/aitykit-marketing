### Step 1: Research Foundation

```
Create content strategy research for Planerio:

PHASE 1 - Audience Research
- What topics do our 3 personas care about?
- What questions are they asking?

PHASE 2 - Keyword Research

### Step 2: Define Content Pillars

```
Based on the research, define our content pillars.

Create a Content Strategy document with:

## Content Pillars (4-5 main topics we'll own)
1. Remote team coordination
2. Deep work practices
3. Productivity measurement
4. Team culture in remote work

For each pillar:
- Why it matters to our personas
- Key subtopics to cover
- SEO keywords to target

Save as exercises/markit/campaigns/content-strategy.md
```

### Step 3: Create Content Calendar

```
Create a 30-day content calendar:

For each week, include:
- Blog posts (2-3 per week with titles, keywords, personas)
- Email newsletter theme
- Daily social media topics
- One premium content piece (guide, template, tool)

Format as a table for easy reference.

```

### Step 4: Pillar Page Planning

```
Design a pillar content strategy:

Pillar Page: "The Complete Guide to Remote Team Productivity"
- 3000-5000 words, comprehensive resource

Supporting Cluster Content (10 posts):
- List 10 specific blog post titles
- Each targets a long-tail keyword
- All link back to the pillar page

Save as exercises/markit/content/blog/pillar-strategy.md
```

### Step 5: Content Production Workflow

```
Design our content production workflow:

STAGES:
1. Research - Topic validation, source gathering
2. Outline - Structure, SEO optimization
3. Draft - First version
4. Review - Sub-agent feedback
5. Polish - Final edits
6. Publish - CMS upload, promotion

For each stage, define:
- What happens
- Who's responsible
- Quality checks
- Timeline

Save as exercises/markit/templates/content-production-workflow.md
```

### Step 6: Multi-Channel Distribution

```
Create a content repurposing plan:

For each blog post, automatically create:
1. LinkedIn article (shortened)
2. Twitter thread (key points)
3. Email newsletter feature
4. Social media snippets (5 posts)
5. Slide deck outline

Create example for one blog post topic.

## KPIs by Content Type
- Blog posts: traffic, time on page, conversions
- Email: open rate, click rate, conversions
- Social: engagement, reach, clicks

## Reporting Template
- Weekly metrics summary
- Monthly deep dive
- Quarterly strategy review

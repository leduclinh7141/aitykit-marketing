### Lesson Overview

---

**Module 2.2: Develop Content Strategy**

A content strategy transforms random content creation into a systematic growth engine. Let's build one for Planerio.

**Duration:** ~40 minutes

---

### Step 1: Research Foundation

Start with market and audience research:

```
/research:market "B2B team productivity software - remote work tools market"
```

```
/research:persona "Remote team managers at technology companies - 50-500 employees"
```

```
/research:trend "Remote work productivity - team coordination - async work"
```

### Step 2: SEO Keyword Research

Use SEO commands for keyword foundation:

```
/seo:keywords "remote team productivity"
```

```
/seo:keywords "team coordination software"
```

```
/seo:keywords "deep work for teams"
```

Group keywords into topic clusters:
- Cluster 1: Remote team productivity
- Cluster 2: Team focus time
- Cluster 3: Coordination without meetings

### Step 3: Competitive Content Analysis

Analyze competitor content:

```
/seo:competitor "rescuetime.com"
```

Identify:
- What topics they cover
- Content gaps we can fill
- Keywords they're ranking for

### Step 4: Create Content Calendar

Use campaign calendar for content planning:

```
/campaign:calendar "12 weeks - Planerio content strategy - focus on SEO, thought leadership, lead generation - topics: remote productivity, team coordination, deep work, meeting reduction"
```

### Step 5: Define Content Types

Plan content by funnel stage:

**TOFU (Awareness):**
- Blog posts (SEO-focused)
- Social media content
- Thought leadership

**MOFU (Consideration):**
- Comparison guides
- How-to content
- Case studies

**BOFU (Decision):**
- Product demos
- ROI calculators
- Customer testimonials

### Step 6: Create Pillar Content Strategy

Plan a pillar page strategy:

```
/content:blog "The Complete Guide to Remote Team Productivity: How to Coordinate Focus Time Across Time Zones" "remote team productivity"
```

Cluster content (link to pillar):
1. How to schedule team focus time
2. Reducing meetings without losing alignment
3. Async communication best practices
4. Deep work in remote teams
5. Productivity tracking for teams

### Step 7: Content Production Workflow

Use the content commands for each piece:

**Blog Post Production:**
```
1. /seo:keywords "topic" - Research keywords
2. /content:blog "title" "keyword" - Create post
3. /seo:optimize "post" "keyword" - Optimize
4. Review with seo-specialist agent
5. Review with brand-voice-guardian agent
```

**Social Content Production:**
```
1. /content:social "topic" "linkedin" - LinkedIn post
2. /content:social "topic" "twitter" - Twitter thread
3. Review with conversion-optimizer agent
```

### Step 8: Email Integration

Create email sequences to nurture content consumers:

```
/sequence:nurture "Planerio" "blog readers who downloaded guide"
```

### Step 9: Content Distribution Plan

Use social commands for distribution:

```
/social:schedule "linkedin,twitter" "4 weeks - Planerio content distribution"
```

### Step 10: Measurement Framework

Set up content analytics:

```
/analytics:report "content performance" "organic traffic, engagement, conversions"
```

Key metrics to track:
- Organic traffic by content piece
- Time on page
- Conversion rate per content
- Lead quality from content

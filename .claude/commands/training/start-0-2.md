# /start-0-2 - Your First Marketing Task

## Instructions for Claude

Guide the student through their first real marketing task - creating brand guidelines.

### Lesson Overview

---

**Module 0.2: Your First Marketing Task**

Now let's do some real marketing work. We'll create brand guidelines for Planerio - a document that ensures all our content has a consistent voice.

---

### Step 1: Explain Brand Guidelines

Explain why brand guidelines matter:
- Ensures consistency across all content
- Helps Claude (and humans) write in the right voice
- Documents key messages and terminology
- Prevents off-brand content

### Step 2: Create Brand Guidelines Together

Guide them to create comprehensive brand guidelines:

```
Create brand guidelines for Planerio in exercises/markit/brand/voice-guide.md

Include:
- Brand personality (professional but approachable)
- Tone of voice guidelines
- Key messaging pillars
- Words to use and avoid
- Writing style rules
- Example good vs bad copy
```

Let Claude generate this, then review it with the student.

### Step 3: Create Customer Personas

Now create the target personas:

```
Create 3 customer persona documents in exercises/markit/brand/personas/

1. manager-mark.md - Remote team manager, 35-45, manages 10-15 developers
2. founder-fiona.md - Startup founder, 28-35, juggling many roles
3. director-dana.md - Marketing director, 40-50, mid-size company

For each, include:
- Demographics and role
- Pain points and frustrations
- Goals and motivations
- Current tools they use
- How Planerio helps them
- Information sources they trust
```

### Step 4: Review What We Created

```
Show me all files in exercises/markit/brand/
```

Then read one of the personas:

```
Read the Manager Mark persona
```

### Step 5: The Power of Context

Explain:
- These files now exist in the project
- In future tasks, Claude can reference them
- This is "context awareness" - one of Claude's superpowers
- We'll use these personas throughout the course

### Quick Exercise

Have them try:

```
Based on the Manager Mark persona, write a one-paragraph pitch for Planerio that would resonate with him.
```

Show how Claude uses the persona context automatically.

### What's Next

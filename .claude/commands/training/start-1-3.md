### Lesson Overview

---

**Module 1.3: First Marketing Tasks**

Now let's do real marketing work. You'll complete three common tasks that every marketer does regularly.

**Duration:** ~30 minutes

---

### Task 1: Multi-Channel Copy Generation

Generate copy for multiple channels at once:

```
Create launch announcement copy for Planerio across these channels:

1. LinkedIn post (professional, ~200 words)
2. Twitter thread (5 tweets)
3. Email subject line (5 A/B variations)
4. Google Ads headlines (5 variations, max 30 chars each)

Use our brand voice guidelines. Emphasize team coordination.
Save each in exercises/markit/content/ in appropriate subfolders.
```

Review the outputs together. Show iteration:

```
The LinkedIn post feels too salesy. Rewrite it to be more educational - focus on the problem of coordinating deep work time in remote teams.
```

### Task 2: Competitive Analysis

```
Create a competitive analysis comparing Planerio to:
- RescueTime
- Freedom
- Focus@Will

For each competitor, analyze:
- Target audience
- Key features  
- Pricing model
- Unique positioning
- Strengths vs Planerio
- Weaknesses we can exploit

Save as exercises/markit/research/competitors/competitive-analysis.md
```

Ask follow-up questions:

```
Based on this analysis, what's our biggest competitive advantage?
```

### Task 3: Content Calendar

```
Create a 30-day content calendar for Planerio's launch.

Include:
- 4 blog post topics with SEO keywords
- Daily social media themes (LinkedIn, Twitter)
- 1 email per week (4 total)
- Content goals for each piece

Focus on: remote work productivity, team collaboration, deep work

Save as exercises/markit/campaigns/q1-launch/content-calendar.md
```

### Step 4: Expand One Piece

Take a blog topic and expand it:

```
Take the first blog post topic from the calendar. Create a full outline with:
- Working title
- Target keyword
- Meta description
- H2 section headings
- Key points for each section
- CTA

Save as exercises/markit/content/blog/post-1-outline.md
```

### Step 5: Write the Full Post

```
Write the full blog post based on the outline.
Aim for 1500 words, SEO-optimized but natural.
Include actionable tips and examples.
Save as exercises/markit/content/blog/post-1-draft.md
```

### Celebrate

- Multi-channel copy in minutes (normally hours)

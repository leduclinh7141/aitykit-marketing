### Lesson Overview

---

**Module 1.3: First Marketing Tasks**

Now let's do real marketing work. You'll complete three common tasks that every marketer does regularly.

**Duration:** ~30 minutes

---

### Task 1: Multi-Channel Copy Generation

Generate copy for multiple channels using content commands:

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
/content:social "Planerio launch announcement - team productivity coordination for remote teams" "linkedin"
```

**Blog Post:**
```
/content:blog "How Remote Teams Can Coordinate Focus Time Without Endless Meetings" "remote team coordination"
```

**Email:**
```
/content:email "product announcement" "existing subscribers"
```

Review the outputs together. Show iteration:

```
Make the LinkedIn post more educational - focus on the problem of coordinating deep work time
```

### Task 2: Competitive Analysis

Use the competitive analysis command:

```
/competitor:deep "RescueTime - personal time tracking and productivity software"
```

Explain what the `researcher` agent analyzes:
- Target audience
- Key features and positioning
- Pricing model
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Market opportunities

Ask follow-up:
```
Based on this analysis, what's Planerio's biggest competitive advantage?
```

### Task 3: Content Calendar

Use the campaign calendar command:

```
/campaign:calendar "4 weeks - Planerio product launch - focus on remote work productivity, team collaboration, deep work"
```

Review the generated calendar:
- Blog post topics with SEO keywords
- Social media themes by platform
- Email newsletter schedule
- Content goals for each piece

### Step 4: Expand One Piece

Take a topic and expand it using content commands:

```
/content:blog "The Complete Guide to Team Focus Time: How Remote Teams Can Coordinate Deep Work" "team focus time"
```

### Step 5: SEO Optimization

Use SEO commands to optimize:

```
/seo:keywords "remote team productivity"
```

Then:
```
/seo:optimize "the blog post we just created" "team focus time"
```

### Step 6: Review with Specialists

Use reviewer agents (explain these will be covered in detail later):

```
Review the blog post from three perspectives:
1. Brand Voice Guardian - does it match our voice?
2. SEO Specialist - is it optimized for search?
3. Conversion Optimizer - will it drive action?
```

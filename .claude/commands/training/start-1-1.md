### Step 1: Set the Scene

Explain their role:

> You're a Marketing Strategist at **Markit** agency. Your client is **Planerio**. Your mission:
> 1. Launch the product to market
> 2. Generate awareness and signups
> 3. Create content that resonates with remote teams
> 4. Build a sustainable content marketing engine

### Step 2: Review Project Structure

Show them what we've built:

```
Show me the complete structure of exercises/markit/
```

Explain each area:
- `campaigns/` - Where campaign briefs live
- `content/` - All marketing content (blog, email, social, ads)
- `brand/` - Guidelines and personas (we created these!)
- `research/` - Competitive analysis
- `analytics/` - Performance tracking
- `templates/` - Reusable templates

### Step 3: Create First Campaign Brief

Now the real work begins:

```
Create a campaign brief for Planerio's product launch.

Save it to: exercises/markit/campaigns/q1-launch/brief.md

Include:
- Campaign objectives (1000 trial signups in 30 days)
- Target audience (reference our personas)
- Key messages (reference brand guidelines)
- Channel strategy (LinkedIn, Google Ads, Content, Email)
- Budget allocation ($50K total)
- Success metrics
- Timeline (6 weeks)

Use our brand voice guidelines and personas for context.
```

### Step 4: Review the Brief

```
Read the campaign brief we just created
```

Point out how Claude:
- Referenced the brand guidelines automatically
- Used persona insights
- Created a professional, comprehensive document

### Step 5: The Iteration Power

Show them refinement:

```
The target audience section needs more depth. Expand it with:
- Day in the life of Manager Mark
- Specific pain points we're addressing
- Why now is the right time for Planerio
```

Explain: Iteration is key. First drafts are starting points.

### Step 6: Context Awareness Demo

Demonstrate the power:

```
Based on the campaign brief and our personas, write 3 LinkedIn post ideas that would resonate with Manager Mark.
```

Show how Claude pulls from multiple files automatically.

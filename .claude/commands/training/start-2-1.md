### Lesson Overview

---

**Module 2.1: Write a Campaign Brief**

Welcome to Module 2! Now we apply everything you've learned to real marketing workflows. Campaign briefs are the foundation of successful execution.

**Duration:** ~45 minutes

---

### Step 1: Explain Collaborative Approach

> Claude is your strategic partner, not a replacement for your marketing expertise. You bring insights, market knowledge, and strategic thinking. Claude helps articulate and structure those ideas.

### Step 2: Gather Strategic Input

Ask the student for their strategic thinking:

```
Let's create a comprehensive campaign brief for Planerio's Q2 growth campaign.

First, tell me your strategic thinking:
- What's the primary goal? (e.g., 2000 trial signups)
- What's the budget?
- What's the timeframe?
- Any specific channels to focus on?
- What's the key message this quarter?
```

Wait for their input, then proceed.

### Step 3: Generate Campaign Brief

```
Create a comprehensive campaign brief based on that strategy.
Save to exercises/markit/campaigns/q2-growth/brief.md

Include these sections:
1. Executive Summary
2. Background & Context
3. Campaign Objectives (SMART goals)
4. Target Audience (reference our personas)
5. Key Messages
6. Creative Strategy
7. Channel Strategy (with budget allocation)
8. Timeline & Milestones
9. Budget Breakdown
10. Success Metrics
11. Risk Assessment
```

### Step 4: Review and Refine

```
The target audience section needs more depth. Expand with:
- Day in the life of each persona
- Specific pain points we're addressing
- Why now is the right time
- Information sources they trust
```

### Step 5: Get Multi-Perspective Feedback

```
Review this campaign brief from three perspectives:

1. Executive/Stakeholder - Look for unclear objectives, missing ROI projections
2. Creative Director - Is the creative direction clear enough to execute?
3. Channel Specialist - Is budget allocation realistic for these channels?

Provide constructive feedback for each.

### Step 6: Create Supporting Documents

```
Based on the campaign brief, create:

1. Creative Brief (for design team)
   - Single-minded proposition
   - Tone and manner
   - Deliverables list
   Save as exercises/markit/campaigns/q2-growth/creative-brief.md

2. Media Brief (for ad buying)
   - Audience targeting
   - Budget by channel
   - KPIs per channel
   Save as exercises/markit/campaigns/q2-growth/media-brief.md

3. Measurement Plan
   - Primary and secondary KPIs
   - Tracking methods
   - Reporting cadence
   Save as exercises/markit/campaigns/q2-growth/measurement-plan.md
```

### Step 7: Scenario Planning

```
Create three scenarios for this campaign:

1. Best case (150% of goal) - What would cause this? How do we scale?
2. Base case (100% of goal) - Expected performance
3. Worst case (50% of goal) - What would cause this? How do we respond?

Save as exercises/markit/campaigns/q2-growth/scenario-planning.md
```

### Step 8: Save as Template

```
Create a reusable campaign brief template based on what we built.
Remove Planerio-specific details but keep the structure.
Save as exercises/markit/templates/campaign-brief-template.md
```

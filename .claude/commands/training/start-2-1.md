### Lesson Overview

---

**Module 2.1: Write a Campaign Brief**

Welcome to Module 2! Now we apply everything you've learned to real marketing workflows. Campaign briefs are the foundation of successful execution.

**Duration:** ~45 minutes

---

### Step 1: Explain Collaborative Approach

> Claude is your strategic partner, not a replacement for your marketing expertise. You bring insights, market knowledge, and strategic thinking. Claude helps articulate and structure those ideas.

### Step 2: Gather Strategic Input

Ask the student for their strategic thinking:

```
Let's create a comprehensive campaign brief for Planerio's Q2 growth campaign.

First, tell me your strategic thinking:
- What's the primary goal? (e.g., 2000 trial signups)
- What's the budget?
- What's the timeframe?
- Any specific channels to focus on?
- What's the key message this quarter?
```

Wait for their input, then proceed.

### Step 3: Use Campaign Plan Command

Use the campaign planning command:

```
/campaign:plan "Planerio Q2 Growth - Goal: 2000 trial signups, Budget: $75K, Timeframe: 8 weeks, Channels: LinkedIn Ads, Content Marketing, Email Nurture, Key message: Team-wide focus time coordination"
```

Review the comprehensive campaign plan generated by the `planner` agent.

### Step 4: Generate Creative Brief

Now use the creative brief command:

```
/campaign:brief "Planerio Q2 Growth Campaign"
```

Explain what the creative brief includes:
- Single-minded proposition
- Target audience insights
- Tone and manner
- Deliverables list
- Creative mandatories

### Step 5: Get Multi-Perspective Feedback

Use reviewer agents:

```
Review the Q2 campaign plan from three perspectives:

1. `manager-maria` (Marketing Manager) - Is this executable by a marketing team?
2. `conversion-optimizer` - Will this campaign structure drive conversions?
3. `brand-voice-guardian` - Is the messaging on-brand?

Provide specific feedback and recommendations.
```

### Step 6: Create Content Calendar

Use the calendar command:

```
/campaign:calendar "8 weeks - Planerio Q2 Growth - content marketing, social media, email nurture focused on team productivity"
```

### Step 7: Create Supporting Documents

Generate additional campaign assets:

**Lead Scoring Model:**
```
/leads:score "B2B SaaS - technology companies - team productivity"
```

**Welcome Sequence:**
```
/sequence:welcome "Planerio" "trial signups from Q2 campaign"
```

**Nurture Sequence:**
```
/sequence:nurture "Planerio" "engaged leads who haven't converted"
```

### Step 8: Competitive Preparation

Prepare competitive materials:

```
/sales:battlecard "RescueTime - main competitor for productivity tools"
```

```
/competitor:deep "Freedom app - focus and productivity blocking"
```

### Step 9: Create Measurement Plan

Set up analytics:

```
/analytics:funnel "trial signup funnel - awareness to trial to paid"
```

### Step 10: Save as Template

Explain that this workflow can be repeated for any campaign:

```
Campaign Brief Workflow:
1. /campaign:plan - Strategic plan
2. /campaign:brief - Creative brief
3. /campaign:calendar - Content calendar
4. /leads:score - Lead qualification
5. /sequence:welcome - New lead nurture
6. /sequence:nurture - Ongoing nurture
7. /sales:battlecard - Competitive prep
8. /analytics:funnel - Measurement setup
```

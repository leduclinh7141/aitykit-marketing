# Attribution Models

Understanding marketing attribution.

## Model Types

### Last-Click Attribution
- 100% credit to final touchpoint
- Simplest model
- Favors bottom-funnel
- Ignores awareness efforts

**Best for:** Simple funnels, direct response

### First-Click Attribution
- 100% credit to first touchpoint
- Values awareness activities
- Ignores nurturing efforts
- Opposite bias to last-click

**Best for:** Brand awareness focus

### Linear Attribution
- Equal credit to all touchpoints
- No bias toward position
- May overvalue minor touches
- Simple to understand

**Best for:** Balanced view, long cycles

### Time-Decay Attribution
- More credit to recent touches
- Acknowledges momentum
- Still values early touches
- Reflects typical buying

**Best for:** Shorter sales cycles

### Position-Based (U-Shaped)
- 40% first, 40% last, 20% middle
- Values discovery and conversion
- Middle touches underweighted
- Popular compromise model

**Best for:** Most B2B scenarios

### Data-Driven Attribution
- ML determines credit
- Based on actual patterns
- Requires significant data
- Most accurate when available

**Best for:** High-volume, mature analytics

## Choosing a Model

### Questions to Ask
1. What's your sales cycle length?
2. How many touchpoints typical?

# Conversion Principles

Psychology of persuasion and conversion optimization.

## Cialdini's 6 Principles of Persuasion

### 1. Reciprocity
People feel obligated to give back when they receive something.

**Application:**
- Free trials and samples
- Valuable free content
- Unexpected bonuses
- Personalized recommendations

**Example Copy:**
"Get our complete guide free—no strings attached."

### 2. Commitment & Consistency
People want to be consistent with their past actions and statements.

**Application:**
- Small initial commitments (micro-conversions)
- Public commitments
- Progressive disclosure
- Onboarding sequences

**Example Copy:**
"You've already taken the first step by downloading our guide. Here's the logical next step..."

### 3. Social Proof
People look to others' actions to determine their own.

**Application:**
- Customer testimonials
- Case studies with results
- User counts ("Join 10,000+ marketers")
- Real-time activity ("5 people viewing this")
- Expert endorsements

**Example Copy:**
"See why 50,000+ companies trust us with their marketing."

### 4. Authority
People defer to credible experts.

**Application:**
- Certifications and credentials
- Industry awards
- Media mentions ("As seen in...")
- Expert partnerships
- Authoritative content

**Example Copy:**
"Featured by Forbes, TechCrunch, and The Wall Street Journal."

### 5. Liking
People prefer to say yes to those they like.

**Application:**
- Relatable brand personality
- Team photos and bios
- Shared values messaging
- Personalization
- Humor (when appropriate)

**Example Copy:**
"We're marketers too—we get it."

### 6. Scarcity
People value things more when they're less available.

**Application:**
- Limited-time offers
- Limited quantity
- Exclusive access
- Deadline-driven promotions
- Waitlists

**Example Copy:**
"Only 10 spots left at this price—offer ends Friday."

## Loss Aversion

People feel losses more strongly than equivalent gains (2x more powerful).

**Application:**
- Frame benefits as avoiding loss
- Highlight what they'll miss
- Trial expiration reminders
- "Don't let this opportunity pass"

**Example Copy:**
"Don't lose another $10K to inefficient marketing."
vs.
"Save $10K on marketing." (Less effective)

## Cognitive Biases in Marketing

### Anchoring
First piece of information influences subsequent judgments.
- Show original price before discount
- Present highest tier first
- Use comparison tables

### Choice Overload
Too many options lead to decision paralysis.
- Limit choices (rule of 3)
- Recommend "most popular"
- Progressive disclosure

### Bandwagon Effect
People do what they see others doing.
- Popularity indicators
- Trending labels
- "Best seller" badges

### Framing Effect
Presentation affects perception.
- "95% success rate" vs "5% failure rate"
- "$1/day" vs "$365/year"
- "Free shipping over $50" vs "$8 shipping"

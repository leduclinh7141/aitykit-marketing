# Copywriting Frameworks

Proven formulas for persuasive marketing copy.

## AIDA Framework

**Attention → Interest → Desire → Action**

### Attention
Grab attention with a powerful hook.
- Bold statement
- Provocative question
- Surprising statistic
- Pain point identification

### Interest
Build interest by expanding on the hook.
- Explain the problem deeper
- Share relevant story
- Present data/proof

### Desire
Create desire for your solution.
- Paint the transformation
- Show benefits (not just features)
- Use social proof
- Address objections

### Action
Clear call to action.
- Specific next step
- Remove friction
- Add urgency

**Example:**
> **Tired of leads that never convert?** (Attention)
> Most marketing teams waste 80% of their budget on leads that will never buy. (Interest)
> Imagine only talking to prospects who are ready to purchase—qualified, interested, and budgeted. (Desire)
> Start your free trial and see the difference in 7 days. (Action)

## PAS Framework

**Problem → Agitate → Solution**

### Problem
Identify the specific problem your audience faces.

### Agitate
Make the problem feel more urgent and painful.
- Consequences of inaction
- Emotional impact
- Frustration amplification

### Solution
Present your solution as the answer.

**Example:**
> **You're losing money on ads that don't convert.** (Problem)
> Every day without optimization means thousands wasted. Your competitors are getting smarter while your ROAS drops. How long can you afford to fall behind? (Agitate)
> Our AI optimization tool automatically improves your ads 24/7, recovering lost revenue starting day one. (Solution)

## BAB Framework

**Before → After → Bridge**

### Before
Paint the current painful state.

### After
Paint the desired future state.

### Bridge
Your product/service as the bridge between them.

**Example:**
> **Before:** You're manually tracking 15 spreadsheets, missing deadlines, and losing leads in the chaos.
> **After:** One dashboard shows everything. Automated follow-ups. Zero leads falling through cracks.
> **Bridge:** ClaudeKit Marketing connects all your tools and automates your workflow in minutes.

## 4 Ps Framework

**Promise → Picture → Proof → Push**

### Promise
Make a compelling promise/claim.

### Picture
Help them visualize the outcome.

### Proof
Back it up with evidence.

### Push
Push them to act now.

**Example:**
> **Double your email open rates in 30 days.** (Promise)
> Imagine waking up to emails with 40%+ open rates, replies flooding in, and sales conversations starting themselves. (Picture)
> Our customers see an average 2.3x increase in open rates within the first month. See the case studies below. (Proof)
> Start your free trial now—limited to 50 new accounts this month. (Push)

## FOMO Formula

**Fear Of Missing Out**

1. **Establish exclusivity**: "Only for [specific group]"
2. **Create urgency**: "Offer ends [specific time]"
3. **Show scarcity**: "Only [X] left"
4. **Social proof**: "[X] people already joined"
5. **Loss framing**: "Don't miss your chance"

**Example:**
> "Join 500+ marketers who already got access. Only 50 spots left at founding member pricing. Doors close Friday at midnight."

## The 4 U's (Headlines)

Headlines should be:

### Useful
What's in it for them?
- "How to increase conversions by 47%"

### Urgent
Why now?
- "Before your competitors do"

### Unique
What makes this different?
- "The unconventional method"

### Ultra-Specific
Concrete, not vague.
- "47%" not "dramatically"
- "In 30 days" not "quickly"

**Example combining all 4:**
> "The Counterintuitive Email Strategy That Boosted Our Open Rates by 67% in 2 Weeks (Copy It Before Q4)"

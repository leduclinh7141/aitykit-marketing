## Example Review

**Content:** "Influencer Partnership Campaign for Product Launch"

### Quick Take
Interesting idea, but I need to see a clearer ROI case and understand the vetting process. Influencer marketing can work for B2B, but we've had mixed results before.

### Would I Approve This? Maybe

**Why:** The creative approach is sound, but I need more details on influencer selection, contract terms, and measurement before I commit budget and my team's time.

### Team Execution Assessment

**Feasibility:** Doable, but tight on resources
- Required team: Social media manager (40%), content creator (20%), me (10% oversight)
- Time estimate: 6 weeks prep, 4 weeks execution
- Skills gap: We've never done B2B influencer marketing—learning curve
- Current capacity: Social manager is already at 90%, would need to deprioritize something

**Resource Requirements:**
- Budget needed: $15K-25K (influencer fees + production)
- Tools/tech: Influencer platform subscription ($500/mo)
- External help: Possible agency for influencer vetting ($3K)
- Time commitment: ~25 hours/week team time

### Business Impact Analysis

**Potential Upside:**
- Pipeline impact: 50-75 MQLs if targeting matches our ICP
- Lead quality: Depends heavily on influencer audience alignment
- Brand lift: Could position us as innovative in conservative industry
- Efficiency gains: None—this is additive effort

**ROI Projection:**
- Investment: $20K + 100 hours
- Expected return: 50 MQLs × 10% conversion = 5 SQLs × $50K ACV = $250K pipeline
- Break-even: Need 1 closed deal to justify
- Confidence level: Medium (risky but potentially high impact)

### Red Flags & Concerns
1. **Influencer-Audience Fit**: B2B influencers in our space are limited
   - Impact: Could waste budget on wrong audience
   - Mitigation: Strict vetting process, pilot with 1-2 before scaling

2. **Attribution Challenge**: Hard to prove influencer ROI
   - Impact: Can't defend budget to CFO
   - Mitigation: Unique UTM codes, dedicated landing pages, clear tracking

3. **Brand Risk**: Wrong influencer could damage reputation
   - Impact: Negative brand association
   - Mitigation: Clear contract terms, content approval rights

### What I'd Change
1. **Pilot First**: Full campaign → Start with 2 influencers, test and learn
   - Why: Reduce risk, prove model before scaling
   - Impact: Lower initial investment, faster learning

2. **Attribution Strategy**: Add crystal-clear tracking and attribution plan
   - Why: I need to prove ROI to keep doing this
   - Impact: Better data for optimization and budget justification

### Questions I'd Ask Before Approving
1. How did you vet these influencers? Show me their audience demographics.
2. What's our exit strategy if the first month doesn't perform?
3. Have we negotiated performance-based pricing vs flat fee?

### Manager's Recommendation

**Verdict:** Approve with changes (pilot approach)

**Next Steps:**
1. Identify 2 target influencers, vet their audiences thoroughly
2. Negotiate pilot deals with performance incentives
3. Build dedicated tracking infrastructure (UTMs, landing pages)
4. Create content approval workflow
5. Set clear success metrics and kill criteria

**Timeline:** 8 weeks (2 weeks setup, 4 weeks pilot, 2 weeks analysis)

**Success Metrics:**
- 25+ MQLs from pilot
- Cost per MQL < $800
- At least 2 SQLs attributed
- Influencer content engagement > 2%

---

**My Perspective:** I'm cautiously optimistic. The approach is creative and could differentiate us, but we need to de-risk it with a pilot and have rock-solid attribution. If the pilot works, I'd definitely scale. If not, we learned something for $8K instead of $25K.

## When to Use This Agent

**Best For:**
